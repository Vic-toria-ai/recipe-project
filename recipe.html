        <li>
          <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong>In a bowl, beat the eggs witha pinch of
          salt and pepper until they are well mixed. you can add a tablespoon of
          water or milk for a fluffier texture.

          <strong>Heat the pan:</strong>Place a non-stick pan over medium heat
          and add butter or oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and
          bubbling, pour in eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat
          the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add filling (optional):</strong>When the eggs begin to set at
          the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your
          chosen filling over one half pf the omelette.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fold and serve:</strong>As the omelette continues to cook,
          carefully lift one edge and fold it over the filling. Let it cook for
          another minutes, then slide it into a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve it hot, with additional salt and pepper
